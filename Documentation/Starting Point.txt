After creation of the first test bot go back to Banana Bot, review the old python code and write down notes about what it does.
The notes file for this is Banana Review.txt

After reviewing Banana, review the purpose of the file(s) and based on that create new notes that better outlines the scope of Naners and notes that work better with JS.
The notes file for this is Naners-Scope.txt

The only functionality that needs to be created from here forward, is the slash commands, their properites, and any other type of interaction deemed nessecary from 
the previous bot.

After recreating the previous bot in JS consider exploring new functionality and new possiblities with discord. Impliment ideas from friends or things you find on the internet.
